### Gscore
The **Gene Set Correlation Enrichment Analysis** (Gscore) is a powerful pathway analysis method implemented in Python. Gscore is designed to uncover meaningful relationships among genes. By evaluating coexpressed gene pairs within a set of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), Gscore identifies enriched patterns in comparison to a broader collection of DEGs, often organized as gene sets like pathways. Leveraging gene expression data, Gscore constructs a coexpression network to illuminate how groups of genes collaborate, offering insights into their potential functional interactions.
